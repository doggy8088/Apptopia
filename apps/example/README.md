# Example App

This is an example directory structure showing how apps should be organized according to AGENTS.md guidelines.

Each Issue's app should follow this pattern:
- Located in `apps/issue-N/` where N is the issue number (e.g., `apps/issue-1/`, `apps/issue-42/`)
- Has its own README.md
- Has its own CI/CD workflow at `.github/workflows/ci_N.yml`

For actual implementations, replace "example" with "issue-N" format where N is your issue number.
