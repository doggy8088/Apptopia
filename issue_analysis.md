## Issue #11: [工具] 美食地圖

**Status:** Need Clarification
**Last Action By:** github-actions[bot] (2026-02-21)
**User:** funew4670

### Analysis
The requirements for the "Food Map" tool are currently insufficient for development planning. The following key information is missing:
1.  **Data Source & Authorization:** Whether to use Google Places/Maps API or another source. If Google API, is an API Key provided? What are the quota/budget limits? Is scraping (without official API) acceptable (usually discouraged)?
2.  **Search Scope:** Is the initial version limited to a single city or global? Does it support user input for location/radius/keywords?
3.  **Map Interaction:** What details should be shown on clicking a restaurant? Sorting options? Pagination vs. load all?
4.  **Acceptance Criteria:** Specific examples of search queries and expected results are needed.

### Proposed Comment (Traditional Chinese)
您好，我們目前仍在等待您針對上述問題的回覆（資料來源、搜尋範圍、地圖與清單互動細節、驗收樣本等）。由於需求尚不明確，目前無法制定開發計畫。若您能提供更多資訊，我們將很樂意協助您評估與規劃。謝謝！
